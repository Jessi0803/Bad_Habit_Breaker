## Alternative Demo Flow (If Time Permits)

### Extended Demo (3 minutes)

3. **Social**: "Share your funniest interventions"
4. **Multi-device**: "Works on mobile coming soon"

---

## Backup Plan (If Live Demo Fails)

### **Option A: Pre-recorded Video**
- Have a polished 90-second video ready
- Show it without apologizing
- Walk through code after

### **Option B: Static Demo**
- Show screenshots with narration
- "Here's what happens when..."
- Focus more on architecture

### **Option C: Code Walkthrough**
- If all else fails, show the code
- Explain the technical complexity
- Emphasize partner integrations

---

## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: "How do you detect 'bad' behavior?"**
> A: "Currently rule-based - time thresholds per domain. But we're building an LLM-powered version that detects patterns like rapid scrolling, excessive clicking, etc."

**Q: "Can I customize which sites to monitor?"**
> A: "Absolutely. You can add any domain with custom thresholds. Want to limit YouTube to 10 minutes? Done."

**Q: "Privacy concerns - are you tracking my data?"**
> A: "All monitoring happens locally in your browser. Nothing sent to our servers unless you opt-in for cloud sync."

**Q: "How do you use ElevenLabs?"**
> A: "Voice generation for interventions. You can clone your mom's voice, your favorite celebrity, or use our pre-made personalities."

**Q: "What makes this different from screen time apps?"**
> A: "Traditional blockers are binary - allow or block. We're conversational. The AI *talks* to you, makes it personal. Way harder to ignore your mom's voice than a popup."

**Q: "How do you use Clerk/Bolt/other partners?"**
> A: "Clerk handles authentication for cross-device sync. Bolt deploys our backend instantly. All integrations make this production-ready, not just a prototype."

**Q: "Can I really clone my mom's voice?"**
> A: "Yes! ElevenLabs requires just 30 seconds of audio. Imagine the guilt trip potential!" *[Laugh]*

**Q: "Will this work on other browsers?"**
> A: "Currently Chrome only, but Firefox and Edge use similar APIs. We can port it quickly."

**Q: "How do you monetize?"**
> A: "Freemium model. Basic version free, premium features like custom voices, advanced analytics, team accounts for companies."
